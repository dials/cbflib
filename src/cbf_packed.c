 * The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   *
 * information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  *
 * Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     *
 * recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             *
 * Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       *
 * determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         *
 * and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    *
 * more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches *
 * are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange *
 * and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     *
 * activities in other fields.                                        *
 *                                                                    *

 * The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          *
 * interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     *
 * a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     *
 * exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  *
 * science.                                                           *

 *                                                                    *

/*  Update pointers for averaging in J. P. Abrahams CCP4 compression
    algorithm.
    
    On entry, trail_char_data[0] should point to the data element
    immediately prior to the next data element to be processed, either
    in the same row (fastest index) or, at the end of the prior row
    if the next data element to be processed is at the end of a row
    
    ndimfast, ndimmid, ndimslow should point to the indices of the same
    data element as trail_char_data[0] points to.  These values
    will be incremented to be the indices of the next data element
    to be processed before populating trail_char_data.
    
    On exit, trail_char_data[0..7] will have been populated with
    pointers to the data elements to be used in forming the average.
    Elements that will not be used will be set to NULL.   Note
    that trail_char_data[0] may be set to NULL.             
    
    If we mark the next element to be processed with a "*" and the
    entries in trail_char_data with their array indices 0 .. 7, the
    possible patterns of settings in the general case are:
    
    current section:
    
         - - - - 0 * - - - -
         - - - - 3 2 1 - - - 
         - - - - - - - - - -
         
    prior section:
    
         - - - - - 4 - - - -
         - - - - 7 6 5 - - - 
         - - - - - - - - - -
             
    If there is no prior section (i.e. ndimslow is 0, or 
    the CBF_UNCORRELATED_SECTIONS flag is set
    to indicate discontinuous sections), the values
    for trail_char_data[4..7] will all be NULL.  When
    there is a prior section, trail_char_data[5..7] are
    pointers to the elements immediately below the
    elements pointed to by trail_char_data[1..3], but
    trail_char_data[4] is one element further along
    its row to be directly below the next element to
    be processed.
    
    The first element of the first row of the first section
    is a special case, with no averaging.  This function
    should not be called for that case.

    In the first row of the first section (ndimmid == 0,
    and ndimslow == 0), after the first element (ndimfast > 0), 
    only trail_char_data[0] is used
    
    current section:
    
         - - - - 0 * - - - -

    For subsequent rows of the first section (ndimmid > 0,
    and ndimslow == 0), for the first element (ndimfast == 0), 
    two elements from the prior row are used:
    
    current section:
    
         * - - - - - - - - -
         2 1 - - - - - - - -
         - - - - - - - - - -

    while for element after the first element, but before
    the last element of the row, a full set of 4 elements 
    is used:
    
    current section:
    
         - - - - 0 * - - - -
         - - - - 3 2 1 - - - 
         - - - - - - - - - -
         
    For the last element of a row (ndimfast == dimfast-1), two
    elements are used
    
    current section:
    
         - - - - - - - - 0 *
         - - - - - - - - - 2 
         - - - - - - - - - -
         
    For sections after the first section, provided the
    CBF_UNCORRELATED_SECTIONS flag is not set in compression,
    for each non-NULL entry in trail_char_data [0..3] an entry 
    is made in trail_char_data [4..7], except for the
    first element of the first row of a section.  In that
    case an entry is made in trail_char_data[4].
