 * The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   *
 * information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  *
 * Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     *
 * recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             *
 * Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       *
 * determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         *
 * and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    *
 * more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches *
 * are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange *
 * and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     *
 * activities in other fields.                                        *
 *                                                                    *

 * The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          *
 * interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     *
 * a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     *
 * exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  *
 * science.                                                           *

/*  The nibble offset algorithm is a variant on 
    A. P. Hammersley's byte offset algorithm.  The
    major differences are that the compression modes
    are "sticky", the compression can be reset at
    any point to allow for block parallelism, and
    the basic unit of compression is the nibble,
    but for very clean data, the dibit is also supported.
 
    This versions is set up to fully support parallel
    operations by also allowing the specification of the start address
    in the image for each block after a reset.  Therefore
    the blocks do not have to be in order.
 
    The data stream starts with and in general uses
    a mode-setting octet presented in one if three
    forms, a single dibit a0, two dibits a0, a1, or
    two dibits and a nibble a0, a1, b:
 
    a0 a1 b    octet     meaning
    00 00 0000 0x00 --   reset to zero
    01         0x01 --   up 1 mode
    10         0x02 --   dibit mode
    11         0x03 --   up n modes
    00 01      0x04 --   nibble mode
    00 11      0x0C --   6-bit mode
    00 10      0x08 --   byte mode
    00 00 0011 0x30 --   12-bit word mode
    00 00 0001 0x10 --   16-bit word mode
    00 00 0010 0x20 --   32-bit word mode
    00 00 0100 0x40 --   64-bit word mode
    00 00 1100 0xC0 --   specify starting address
 
    The reset to zero is followed by a new mode octet
    A reset to zero resets the prior value for delta to zero
 
    The up n modes code is followed immediately
    by a dibit specifying 2 less than the number of modes 
    by which to change, and then by a delta in the mode.
 
    Note that up n modes has no effect until
    an actual mode has been set and can be used immediately
    after a reset to pad to nibble, octet or double-word
    boundaries.
 
    Once a mode is established, it is followed by a stream 
    of deltas of that size (for modes 2 or 4-64) or by one delta
    of that size and then a stream of deltas of the size that
    was in effect before an up or down giving little-endian 
    offsets from the currently accumulated value.  If the 
    offset is one of the following in the indicated mode
 
       dibit mode:       0x2
       nibble mode:      0x8
       6-bit mode:       0x20
       byte mode:        0x80
       12-bit word mode  0x800
       16-bit word mode  0x8000
       32-bit word mode  0x8000 0000
       64-bit word mode  0x8000 0000 0000 0000
 
     it is followed by the new mode as 1 or 2 dibits or
     2 dibits and a nibble a1 a1 b.  If a1 is 1 or 2 or 3,
     that is the new mode.  If a1 is zero and a2 is 1 or 2
     the new mode is a2*4.  If a2 is 3 the new mode is
     a2*2.  If both a1 and a2 are zero, the new mode is 
     b*16 unless b is 3.  If b is 3 the new mode is b*4
 
     The 0xC0 flag is followed by a second mode giving
     the number of bytes of image starting offset address
     followed by the image offset address followed by the
     mode of that data.   0xC0 also acts as a reset.
     Use of the 0xC0 flag is not required.  Addresses
     default to sequential starting from 0, but is
     provided to faciliate parallel compression.
 
     The array succs is indexed by mode (not mode-1) and
     returns the next larger mode, so succs[2] = 4,
     succs[4] = 6, succs[6] = 8, succs[8] = 12, etc.
