DESCRIPTION
cbf_read_file reads the CBF or CIF file file into the CBF object 
specified by handle, using the CIF 1.0 convention of 80 character 
lines. cbf_read_widefile reads the CBF or CIF file file into the CBF 
object specified by handle, using the CIF 1.1 convention of 2048 
character lines. A warning is issued to stderr for ascii lines over 
the limit. No test is performed on binary sections.
Validation is performed in three ways levels: during the lexical 
scan, during the parse, and, if a dictionary was converted, against 
the value types, value enumerations, categories and parent-child 
relationships specified in the dictionary.
flags controls the interpretation of binary section headers, the 
parsing of brackets constructs and the parsing of treble-quoted 
strings.
MSG_DIGEST:               Instructs CBFlib to check that the digest 
of the binary section matches any header digest value. If the digests 
do not match, the call will return CBF_FORMAT. This evaluation and 
comparison is delayed (a  \"lazy \" evaluation) to ensure maximal 
processing efficiency. If an immediately evaluation is required, see 
MSG_DIGESTNOW, below. MSG_DIGESTNOW:            Instructs CBFlib to 
check that the digest of the binary section matches any header 
digeste value. If the digests do not match, the call will return 
CBF_FORMAT. This evaluation and comparison is performed during 
initial parsing of the section to ensure timely error reporting at 
the expense of processing efficiency. If a more efficient delayed ( 
\"lazy \") evaluation is required, see MSG_DIGEST, above. 
MSG_DIGESTWARN:           Instructs CBFlib to check that the digest 
of the binary section matches any header digeste value. If the 
digests do not match, a warning message will be sent to stderr, but 
processing will attempt to continue. This evaluation and comparison 
is first performed during initial parsing of the section to ensure 
timely error reporting at the expense of processing efficiency. An 
mismatch of the message digest usually indicates a serious error, but 
it is sometimes worth continuing processing to try to isolate the 
cause of the error. Use this option with caution. MSG_NODIGEST:

alternative to the comma. PARSE_TRIPLE_QUOTES:      Accept DDLm 
triple-quoted  \" \" \"item,item,...item \" \" \" or 
'''item,item,...item''' constructs as valid, stripping embedded

DESCRIPTION
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters sets *compression, *binary_id, 
*elsize, *elsigned, *elunsigned, *elements, *minelement and 
*maxelement to values read from the binary value of the item at the 
current column and row. This provides all the arguments needed for a 
subsequent call to cbf_set_integerarray, if a copy of the array is to 
be made into another CIF or CBF. cbf_get_realarrayparameters sets 
*compression, *binary_id, *elsize, *elements to values read from the 
binary value of the item at the current column and row. This provides 
all the arguments needed for a subsequent call to cbf_set_realarray, 
if a copy of the arry is to be made into another CIF or CBF.
The variants cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims, 
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims_fs, 
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims_sf, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims_fs, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims_sf set **byteorder, *dimfast, 
*dimmid, *dimslow, and *padding as well, providing the additional 
parameters needed for a subsequent call to cbf_set_integerarray_wdims 
or cbf_set_realarray_wdims.
The value returned in *byteorder is a pointer either to the string  
\"little_endian \" or to the string  \"big_endian \". This should be 
the byte order of the data, not necessarily of the host machine. No 
attempt should be made to modify this string. At this time only  
\"little_endian \" will be returned.
The values returned in *dimfast, *dimmid and *dimslow are the sizes 
of the fastest changing, second fastest changing and third fastest 
changing dimensions of the array, if specified, or zero, if not 
specified.
The value returned in *padding is the size of the post-data padding, 
if any and if specified in the data header. The value is given as a 
count of octets.
If the value is not binary, the function returns CBF_ASCII.
ARGUMENTS

elsize        Size in bytes of each array element. binary_id     
Pointer to the destination integer binary identifier. elsigned

DESCRIPTION
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters sets *compression, *binary_id, 
*elsize, *elsigned, *elunsigned, *elements, *minelement and 
*maxelement to values read from the binary value of the item at the 
current column and row. This provides all the arguments needed for a 
subsequent call to cbf_set_integerarray, if a copy of the array is to 
be made into another CIF or CBF. cbf_get_realarrayparameters sets 
*compression, *binary_id, *elsize, *elements to values read from the 
binary value of the item at the current column and row. This provides 
all the arguments needed for a subsequent call to cbf_set_realarray, 
if a copy of the arry is to be made into another CIF or CBF.
The variants cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims, 
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims_fs, 
cbf_get_integerarrayparameters_wdims_sf, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims_fs, 
cbf_get_realarrayparameters_wdims_sf set **byteorder, *dimfast, 
*dimmid, *dimslow, and *padding as well, providing the additional 
parameters needed for a subsequent call to cbf_set_integerarray_wdims 
or cbf_set_realarray_wdims.
The value returned in *byteorder is a pointer either to the string  
\"little_endian \" or to the string  \"big_endian \". This should be 
the byte order of the data, not necessarily of the host machine. No 
attempt should be made to modify this string. At this time only  
\"little_endian \" will be returned.
The values returned in *dimfast, *dimmid and *dimslow are the sizes 
of the fastest changing, second fastest changing and third fastest 
changing dimensions of the array, if specified, or zero, if not 
specified.
The value returned in *padding is the size of the post-data padding, 
if any and if specified in the data header. The value is given as a 
count of octets.
If the value is not binary, the function returns CBF_ASCII.
ARGUMENTS
handle        CBF handle. compression   Compression method used. 
elsize        Size in bytes of each array element. binary_id     
Pointer to the destination integer binary identifier. elsigned      
Pointer to an integer. Set to 1 if the elements can be read as signed 
integers. elunsigned    Pointer to an integer. Set to 1 if the 
elements can be read as unsigned integers. elements      Pointer to 
the destination number of elements. minelement    Pointer to the 
destination smallest element. maxelement    Pointer to the

dimension. dimmid        Pointer to the destination second fastest 
dimension. dimslow       Pointer to the destination third fastest 
dimension. padding       Pointer to the destination padding size.

DESCRIPTION
cbf_get_integerarray reads the binary value of the item at the 
current column and row into an integer array. The array consists of 
elements elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array. The 
elements are signed if elsigned is non-0 and unsigned otherwise. 
*binary_id is set to the binary section identifier and *elements_read 
to the number of elements actually read. cbf_get_realarray reads the 
binary value of the item at the current column and row into a real 
array. The array consists of elements elements of elsize bytes each, 
starting at array. *binary_id is set to the binary section identifier 
and *elements_read to the number of elements actually read.
If any element in the integer binary data cant fit into the 
destination element, the destination is set the nearest possible 
value.
If the value is not binary, the function returns CBF_ASCII.
If the requested number of elements cant be read, the function will 
read as many as it can and then return CBF_ENDOFDATA.
Currently, the destination array must consist of chars, shorts or 
ints (signed or unsigned). If elsize is not equal to sizeof (char), 
sizeof (short) or sizeof (int), for cbf_get_integerarray, or 
sizeof(double) or sizeof(float), for cbf_get_realarray the function 
returns CBF_ARGUMENT.
An additional restriction in the current version of CBFlib is that 
values too large to fit in an int are not correctly decompressed. As 
an example, if the machine with 32-bit ints is reading an array 
containing a value outside the range 0 .. 2^^32-1 (unsigned) or 
-2^^31 .. 2^^31-1 (signed), the array will not be correctly 
decompressed. This restriction will be removed in a future release. 
For cbf_get_realarray, only IEEE format is supported. No conversion 
to other floating point formats is done at this time.

only. With large arrays (like images) it should be used only for

DESCRIPTION
cbf_set_integerarray sets the binary value of the item at the current 
column and row to an integer array. The array consists of elements 
elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array. The elements are 
signed if elsigned is non-0 and unsigned otherwise. binary_id is the 
binary section identifier. cbf_set_realarray sets the binary value of 
the item at the current column and row to an integer array. The array 
consists of elements elements of elsize bytes each, starting at 
array. binary_id is the binary section identifier.
The cbf_set_integerarray_wdims, cbf_set_integerarray_wdims_fs, 
cbf_set_integerarray_wdims_sf, cbf_set_realarray_wdims, 
cbf_set_realarray_wdims_fs and cbf_set_realarray_wdims_sf variants 
allow the data header values of byteorder, dimfast, dimmid, dimslow 
and padding to be set to the data byte order, the fastest, second 
fastest and third fastest array dimensions and the size in byte of 
the post data padding to be used.
The array will be compressed using the compression scheme specifed by 
compression. Currently, the available schemes are:
CBF_CANONICAL       Canonical-code compression (section 3.3.1) 
CBF_PACKED          CCP4-style packing (section 3.3.2) CBF_PACKED_V2  
     CCP4-style packing, version 2 (section 3.3.2) CBF_BYTE_OFFSET    
 Simple  \"byte_offset \" compression. CBF_NIBBLE_OFFSET   Simple  
\"nibble_offset \" compression. CBF_NONE            No compression. 
NOTE: This scheme is by far the slowest of the four and uses much 
more disk space. It is intended for routine use with small arrays 
only. With large arrays (like images) it should be used only for 
debugging.
The values compressed are limited to 64 bits. If any element in the 
array is larger than 64 bits, the value compressed is the nearest 
64-bit value.
Currently, the source array must consist of chars, shorts or ints 
(signed or unsigned), for cbf_set_integerarray, or IEEE doubles or 
floats for cbf_set_realarray. If elsize is not equal to sizeof 
(char), sizeof (short) or sizeof (int), the function returns 
CBF_ARGUMENT.
ARGUMENTS

binary_id     Integer binary identifier. array         Pointer to the 
source array. elsize        Size in bytes of each source array

the item at the current column and row to an integer array. The array 
consists of elements elements of elsize bytes each, starting at 
array. binary_id is the binary section identifier.
The cbf_set_integerarray_wdims, cbf_set_integerarray_wdims_fs, 
cbf_set_integerarray_wdims_sf, cbf_set_realarray_wdims, 
cbf_set_realarray_wdims_fs and cbf_set_realarray_wdims_sf variants 
allow the data header values of byteorder, dimfast, dimmid, dimslow 
and padding to be set to the data byte order, the fastest, second 
fastest and third fastest array dimensions and the size in byte of 
the post data padding to be used.
The array will be compressed using the compression scheme specifed by 
compression. Currently, the available schemes are:
CBF_CANONICAL       Canonical-code compression (section 3.3.1) 
CBF_PACKED          CCP4-style packing (section 3.3.2) CBF_PACKED_V2  
     CCP4-style packing, version 2 (section 3.3.2) CBF_BYTE_OFFSET    
 Simple  \"byte_offset \" compression. CBF_NIBBLE_OFFSET   Simple  
\"nibble_offset \" compression. CBF_NONE            No compression. 
NOTE: This scheme is by far the slowest of the four and uses much 
more disk space. It is intended for routine use with small arrays 
only. With large arrays (like images) it should be used only for 
debugging.
The values compressed are limited to 64 bits. If any element in the 
array is larger than 64 bits, the value compressed is the nearest 
64-bit value.
Currently, the source array must consist of chars, shorts or ints 
(signed or unsigned), for cbf_set_integerarray, or IEEE doubles or 
floats for cbf_set_realarray. If elsize is not equal to sizeof 
(char), sizeof (short) or sizeof (int), the function returns 
CBF_ARGUMENT.
ARGUMENTS
handle        CBF handle. compression   Compression method to use. 
binary_id     Integer binary identifier. array         Pointer to the 
source array. elsize        Size in bytes of each source array 
element. elsigned      Set to non-0 if the source array elements are 
signed. elements      The number of elements in the array

DESCRIPTION
cbf_set_image, cbf_set_image_fs and cbf_set_image_sf write the image 
array for element number element_number. The array consists of 
ndimfast×ndimslow elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array. 
The elements are signed if elsign is non-zero and unsigned otherwise. 
cbf_set_real_image, cbf_set_real_image_fs and cbf_set_real_image_sf 
write the image array for element number element_number. The array 
consists of ndimfast×ndimslow IEEE double or float elements of elsize 
bytes each, starting at array. cbf_set_3d_image, cbf_set_3d_image_fs 
and cbf_set_3d_image_sf write the 3D image array for element number 
element_number. The array consists of ndimfast×ndimmid×ndimslow 
elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array. The elements are 
signed if elsign is non-0 and unsigned otherwise. 
cbf_set_real_3d_image, cbf_set_real_3d_image_fs and 
cbf_set_real_3d_image_sf writes the 3D image array for element number 
element_number. The array consists of ndimfast×ndimmid×ndimslow IEEE 
double or float elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array.
The _fs calls give the dimensions in a fast-to-slow order. The calls 
with no suffix and the calls _sf calls give the dimensions in 
slow-to-fast order
If the array is 1-dimensional, ndimslow should be the array size and 
ndimfast and, for the 3D calls, ndimmid, should be set to 1. If the 
array is 2-dimensional and the 3D calls are used, ndimslow and 
ndimmid should be used for the array dimensions and ndimfast should 
be set to 1.
The array will be compressed using the compression scheme specifed by 
compression. Currently, the available schemes are:
CBF_CANONICAL     Canonical-code compression (section 3.3.1) 
CBF_PACKED        CCP4-style packing (section 3.3.2) CBF_PACKED_V2    
   CCP4-style packing, version 2 (section 3.3.2) CBF_BYTE_OFFSET     
Simple  \"byte_offset \" compression. CBF_NIBBLE_OFFSET   Simple  
\"nibble_offset \" compression. CBF_NONE          No compression.
The values compressed are limited to 64 bits. If any element in the 
array is larger than 64 bits, the value compressed is the nearest 
64-bit value.
Currently, the source array must consist of chars, shorts or ints 
(signed or unsigned)for cbf_set_image, or IEEE doubles or floats for 
cbf_set_real_image. If elsize is not equal to sizeof (short), sizeof 
(int), sizeof(double) or sizeof(float), the function returns 
CBF_ARGUMENT.
The parameter reserved is presently unused and should be set to 0.
ARGUMENTS

array            Pointer to the image array. elsize           Size in 
bytes of each image array element. elsigned         Set to non-0 if 
the image array elements are signed. ndimslow         Slowest array 
dimension. ndimmid          Second slowest array dimension. ndimfast

The elements are signed if elsign is non-zero and unsigned otherwise. 
cbf_set_real_image, cbf_set_real_image_fs and cbf_set_real_image_sf 
write the image array for element number element_number. The array 
consists of ndimfast×ndimslow IEEE double or float elements of elsize 
bytes each, starting at array. cbf_set_3d_image, cbf_set_3d_image_fs 
and cbf_set_3d_image_sf write the 3D image array for element number 
element_number. The array consists of ndimfast×ndimmid×ndimslow 
elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array. The elements are 
signed if elsign is non-0 and unsigned otherwise. 
cbf_set_real_3d_image, cbf_set_real_3d_image_fs and 
cbf_set_real_3d_image_sf writes the 3D image array for element number 
element_number. The array consists of ndimfast×ndimmid×ndimslow IEEE 
double or float elements of elsize bytes each, starting at array.
The _fs calls give the dimensions in a fast-to-slow order. The calls 
with no suffix and the calls _sf calls give the dimensions in 
slow-to-fast order
If the array is 1-dimensional, ndimslow should be the array size and

array is 2-dimensional and the 3D calls are used, ndimslow and 
ndimmid should be used for the array dimensions and ndimfast should 
be set to 1.
The array will be compressed using the compression scheme specifed by 
compression. Currently, the available schemes are:

Simple  \"byte_offset \" compression. CBF_NIBBLE_OFFSET   Simple  
\"nibble_offset \" compression. CBF_NONE          No compression.
The values compressed are limited to 64 bits. If any element in the

The array will be compressed using the compression scheme specifed by 
compression. Currently, the available schemes are:

Simple  \"byte_offset \" compression. CBF_NIBBLE_OFFSET   Simple  
\"nibble_offset \" compression. CBF_NONE          No compression.
The values compressed are limited to 64 bits. If any element in the 
array is larger than 64 bits, the value compressed is the nearest 
64-bit value.
Currently, the source array must consist of chars, shorts or ints 
(signed or unsigned)for cbf_set_image, or IEEE doubles or floats for 
cbf_set_real_image. If elsize is not equal to sizeof (short), sizeof

axis_number of the detector element element_number converting the 
double pixel size psize from meters to millimeters in storing it in 
the  \"size \" column for the axis axis_number of the detector 
element element_number. The axis_number is numbered from 1, starting 
with the fastest axis.
If a negative axis number is given, the order of axes is reversed, so 
that -1 specifies the slowest axis for cbf_get_pixel_size_fs and the 
fastest axis for cbf_get_pixel_size_sf.
If the  \"array_structure_list \" category does not already exist, it 
is created.
If the appropriate row in the  \"array_structure_list \" catgeory 
does not already exist, it is created.
If the pixel size is not given explcitly in the  \"array_element_size 
category \", the function returns CBF_NOTFOUND.
ARGUMENTS

detector element counting from 0 by order of appearance in the  
\"diffrn_data_frame \" category. axis_number      The number of the

DESCRIPTION
cbf_get_axis_poise sets vector1, vector2, vector3 to point to the 
components of the axis vector for axis axis_id, offset1, offset2, 
offset3 to point to the components of the axis base offset vector for 
axis axis_id, and angle to point to the angle of rotation of axis 
axis_id after application of the axis settings for frame frame_id, 
using ratio, a value between 0 and 1, indicating how far into the 
internal motion in the frame to go. If frame_id is the string  \". 
\", the first frame found is used. If there is more than one frame, 
which frame will be found is indeterminate. If frame_id is NULL, the 
overall setting for the scan are used, rather than those for any 
particular frame. The vector and offset reported are the reference 
vector and offset of the axis axis_id transformed by application of 
all motions of the axes on which axis_id depends.
cbf_get_goniometer_poise vector1, vector2, vector3 to point to the 
components of the axis vector for the goniometer axis, offset1, 
offset2, offset3 to point to the components of the axis base offset 
vector for the goniometer axis, and angle to point to the angle of 
rotation of the goniometer axis after application of all axis 
settings in the goniometer deriving the vector, offset and angle from 
the resulting matrix. Calculation of the vector is indeterminate if 
the angle is zero.
cbf_get_axis_reference_poise sets vector1, vector2, vector3 to point 
to the components of the axis vector for axis axis_id, offset1, 
offset2, offset3 to point to the components of the axis base offset 
vector for axis axis_id unmodified by axis rotations. Any of the 
pointers may be specified as NULL.
