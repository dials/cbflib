DESCRIPTION
cbf_get_beam_center sets *centerfast and *centerslow to the 
displacements in mm along the detector axes from pixel (0, 0) to the 
point at which the beam intersects the detector and *indexfast and 
*indexslow to the corresponding indices. cbf_set_beam_center sets the 
offsets in the axis category for the detector element axis with 
precedence 1 to place the beam center at the position given in mm by 
*centerfast and *centerslow as the displacements in mm along the 
detector axes from pixel (0, 0) to the point at which the beam 
intersects the detector at the indices given *indexfast and 
*indexslow. cbf_set_reference_beam_center sets the displacments in 
the array_structure_list_axis category to place the beam center at 
the position given in mm by *centerfast and *centerslow as the 
displacements in mm along the detector axes from pixel (0, 0) to the 
point at which the beam intersects the detector at the indices given 
by *indexfast and *indexslow. In order to achieve consistent results, 
a reference detector should be used for detector to have all axes at 
their reference settings.
Note that the precedence 1 axis is the fastest axis, so that 
*centerfast and *indexfast are the fast axis components of the center 
and *centerslow and *indexslow are the slow axis components of the 
center.
The _fs calls give the displacments in a fast-to-slow order. The 
calls with no suffix and the calls _sf calls give the displacements 
in slow-to-fast order
Any of the destination pointers may be NULL for getting the beam 
center. For setting the beam axis, either the indices of the center 
must not be NULL.
The indices are non-negative for beam centers within the detector 
surface, but the center for an axis with a negative increment will be 
negative for a beam center within the detector surface.
For cbf_set_beam_center if the diffrn_data_frame category exists with 
a row for the corresponding element id, the values will be set for 
_diffrn_data_frame.center_fast and _diffrn_data_frame.center_slow in 
millimetres and the value of _diffrn_data_frame.center_units will be 
set to 'mm'.
For cbf_set_reference_beam_center if the diffrn_detector_element 
category exists with a row for the corresponding element id, the 
values will be set for _diffrn_detector_element.reference_center_fast 
and _diffrn_detector_element.reference_center_slow in millimetres and 
the value of _diffrn_detector_element.reference_units will be set to 
'mm'.
ARGUMENTS
detector     Detector handle. indexfast    Pointer to the destination 
fast index. indexslow    Pointer to the destination slow index. 
centerfast   Pointer to the destination displacement along the fast 
axis. centerslow   Pointer to the destination displacement along the

Returns an error code on failure or 0 for success.

a reference detector should be used for detector to have all axes at 
their reference settings.
Note that the precedence 1 axis is the fastest axis, so that 
*centerfast and *indexfast are the fast axis components of the center 
and *centerslow and *indexslow are the slow axis components of the

The _fs calls give the displacments in a fast-to-slow order. The 
calls with no suffix and the calls _sf calls give the displacements 
in slow-to-fast order
Any of the destination pointers may be NULL for getting the beam 
center. For setting the beam axis, either the indices of the center 
must not be NULL.
The indices are non-negative for beam centers within the detector 
surface, but the center for an axis with a negative increment will be 
negative for a beam center within the detector surface.
For cbf_set_beam_center if the diffrn_data_frame category exists with 
a row for the corresponding element id, the values will be set for 
_diffrn_data_frame.center_fast and _diffrn_data_frame.center_slow in 
millimetres and the value of _diffrn_data_frame.center_units will be 
set to 'mm'.
For cbf_set_reference_beam_center if the diffrn_detector_element 
category exists with a row for the corresponding element id, the 
values will be set for _diffrn_detector_element.reference_center_fast 
and _diffrn_detector_element.reference_center_slow in millimetres and
