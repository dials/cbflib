 * The Crystallographic Information File (CIF)[1] is a standard for   *
 * information interchange promulgated by the International Union of  *
 * Crystallography (IUCr). CIF (Hall, Allen & Brown, 1991) is the     *
 * recommended method for submitting publications to Acta             *
 * Crystallographica Section C and reports of crystal structure       *
 * determinations to other sections of Acta Crystallographica         *
 * and many other journals. The syntax of a CIF is a subset of the    *
 * more general STAR File[2] format. The CIF and STAR File approaches *
 * are used increasingly in the structural sciences for data exchange *
 * and archiving, and are having a significant influence on these     *
 * activities in other fields.                                        *
 *                                                                    *

 * The IUCr's interest in the STAR File is as a general data          *
 * interchange standard for science, and its interest in the CIF,     *
 * a conformant derivative of the STAR File, is as a concise data     *
 * exchange and archival standard for crystallography and structural  *
 * science.                                                           *
 *                                                                    *

 * * Software claiming to read files written to either the STAR       *
 * File or the CIF standard must be able to extract the pertinent     *
 * data from a file conformant to the STAR File syntax, or the CIF    *
 * syntax, respectively.                                              *

 * * Software claiming to write files in either the STAR File, or     *
 * the CIF, standard must produce files that are conformant to the    *
 * STAR File syntax, or the CIF syntax, respectively.                 *
 *                                                                    *
 * * Software claiming to read definitions from a specific data       *

Define some conditional debug printing macros, in safe and unsafe forms.

TODO: Debug output should be enabled/disabled on a per-source-file or
per-fragment basis by (re?)defining a single flag, to give detailed output
relating to bugs; not throughout the whole library, giving an un-readable
mess of often incorrect (due to the semantically incorrect handling of
'CBF_NOTFOUND' in many functions) and almost entirely irrelevent information.

This will always expand a call of the form 'CBF_PRINT_DEBUG(LVL,MSG);' into a
single statement. This may be a 'do {..} while (0);' statement, a single call
to 'fprintf()', or the null statement ';'. It must _always_ be followed by a
semicolon, which either terminates the statement or provides it.

The value used for 'LVL' _must_ be a small literal integer or a preprocessor
token, for example:

#define INFO 3
CBF_PRINT_DEBUG(3,"foo");
CBF_PRINT_DEBUG(INFO,"bar");

The folowing is not valid:

const int level = 3;
CBF_PRINT_DEBUG(level,"foo");

For maximum portability, the value used for the 'CBF_PRINT_DEBUG_LEVEL' should
be a literal integer and for 'LVL' should be a literal integer or a symbol
which is defined as a literal integer.

The value given for 'MSG' should be a single string, as a literal character
array or as a variable which is a pointer to the start of a character array.
The result of 'cbf_strerror()' is a valid value to use here, as:

CBF_PRINT_DEBUG(3,cbf_strerror(error));
