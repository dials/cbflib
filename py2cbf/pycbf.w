\maketitle

\abstract{
Area detectors at synchrotron facilities can result in huge amounts of data 
being generated very rapidly. 
The IUCr (International Union of Crystallography) has devised a standard file
format for storing and annotating such data, in order that it might be more
easily interchanged and exploited. 
A c library which gives access to this file format has been developed 
by Paul Ellis and Herbert Bernstein (Version 0.7.4, 
http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF/).
In this document a python interface is developed using the SWIG
 (http://www.swig.org)
package in order to give the author easy access to binary cif files.

\section*{Things to do}

\begin{itemize}
\item Write test code to test each and every function for good and bad args etc
\end{itemize}
\section{Introduction}

The CBFlib library (version 0.7.4) is written in the C language, offering C
 (and C++)
programmers a convenient interface to such files.
The current author uses a different language (python) from day to day and 
so a python interface was desired. 
After a short attempt to make a quick and dirty SWIG interface it was decided
that in the long run it would be better to write a proper interface for python.

All of the functions in the library return an integer reflecting error status.
Usually these integers seem to be zero, and a non-zero return value appears
to mean an error occurred.
Actual return values are returned via pointers in argument lists.
In order to simplify the authors life (as a user) all of those integers have
been made to disappear if they are zero, and cause an ``exception'' to 
be generated if they are not zero. 
This solution might not be the best thing to do, and it can always be changed 
where the return value is intended to normally be used.

Actual return values which were passed back via pointer arguments are now
just passed back as (perhaps multiple) return values.
We must look out for INOUT arguments, none seem to have been found yet, but there 
might be exceptions.
The author has a vague suspicion that python functions generally do not modify their
arguments, but this might be wrong.

The library appears to define (at least) three objects. The one we started on
was the cbf\_handle\_struct defined in cbf.h. 
Many of the functions have their first argument as a pointer to one
of these structures. Therefore we make this structure an object and then 
everything which uses it as first argument is a member function for that
object.

In order to pass image data back and forth there is a difficulty that python
seems to lack a good way to represent large arrays.
The standard library offers an "array" object which claims to efficiently
hold homogenous numerical data. 
Sadly this seems to be limited to one-dimensional arrays.
The builtin string object can hold binary data and this was chosen as 
the way to pass the actual binary back and forth between python and CBFlib.
Unfortunately this means the binary data are pretty useless when they arrive
on the python side, so helper functions are provided to convert the data
to a python (standard library) 1D array and also to a "Numeric" array or a
"Numarray" array. 
The latter two are popular extension modules for manipulating large arrays.

\section{Installation prerequisites}

The document you are reading was generated from a nuweb source file. This
is something very similar to latex with a few extensions for writing out
source code files. As such it keeps together the whole package in a single file
and makes it easier to write documentation. You will need a to obtain the 
preprocessing tool nuweb (perhaps from http://nuweb.sourceforge.net) in
order to build from scratch with the file pycbf.w. Preproccessed output
is hopefully also available to you. 
We do not recommend editing the SWIG generated wrappers!!

Only python version 2.4 has been targetted originally (other versions?) so
that you will probably want to have that version of python installed.

We are building binary extensions, so you also need a working c compiler. 
The compiler used by the author was gcc (for both windows and unix) with
the mingw version under windows.

Finally, you need a copy of swig (from www.swig.org) in order to (re)generate
the c wrappers. 

In case all that sounds scary, then fear not, it is likely that a single download
for windows will just work with the right version of python. Unix systems
come with many of those things available anyway.

@i pycbf_i.w

Despite the temptation to just throw everything from the c header files
into the interface, a short experience suggested we are better off to pull 
out only the parts we want and make the calls more pythonic

The input files "CBFhandlewrappers.i", etc. are created by the make\_pycbf.py
script.

\subsection{Exceptions}

We attempt to catch the errors and pass them back to python as 
exceptions. This could still do with a little work to propagage
back the calls causing the errors.

Currently there are two global  constants defined, called error\_message
and error\_status. 
These are filled out when an error occurred, converting the numerical
error value into something the author can read.

There is an implicit assumption that if the library is used 
correctly you will not normally get exceptions. 
This should be addressed further in areas like file opening,
proper python exceptions should be returned.

See the section on exception handling in pycbf.i, above.

Currently you get a meaningful string back. Should perhaps look into
defining these as python exception classes? 
In any case - the SWIG exception handling is defined via the following.
It could have retained the old style if(status = action) but then
harder to see what to return...


\section{Docstrings}

The file doc/CBFlib.html is converted to a file CBFlib.txt to generate the
docstrings and many of the wrappers.  The conversion was done by the
text-based browser, links.

This text document is then parsed by a python script called make\_pycbf.py 
to generate the .i files which are included by the swig wrapper generator.
Unfortunately this more complicated for non-python users but seemed less
error prone and involved less typing for the author.

@i make_pycbf.w

\section{Building python extensions - the setup file}


Based on the contents of the makefile for CBFlib we will just 
pull in all of the library for now. We use the distutils approach.



@o py2setup_py.m4 -i -t
@{
#
#  py2setup_py.m4
#

`# Import the things to build python binary extensions

from distutils.core import setup, Extension

# Make our extension module

e = Extension(''`_py2cbf''`,
              sources = ["pycbf_wrap.c","../src/cbf_simple.c"],
         extra_compile_args=["-g"],
         'm4_ifelse(regexlibdir,`NOREGEXLIBDIR',`library_dirs=["../solib/","../lib/"],',`library_dirs=["../solib/","../lib/","'regexlibdir`"],')`
         'm4_ifelse(regexlib,`NOREGEXLIB',`libraries=["cbf"],',`libraries=["cbf","'regexlib`"],')`
         include_dirs = ["../include","'hdf5_prefix`/include"] )
            
# Build it
setup(name="_py2cbf",ext_modules=[e],)'
@}


\section{Building and testing the resulting package}

Aim to build and test in one go (so that the source and the binary match!!)

\section{Debugging compiled extensions}

Since it can be a bit of a pain to see where things go wrong here is a
quick recipe for poking around with a debugger:

\begin{verbatim}

(gdb) br _PyImport_LoadDynamicModule
Breakpoint 1 at 0x80e4199: file Python/importdl.c, line 28.
\end{verbatim}

This is how to get a breakpoint when loading the module
\begin{verbatim}
(gdb) run

(gdb) cont
Continuing.
\end{verbatim}

We now have a breakpoint where we wanted inside the dynamically loaded file. 
\begin{verbatim}
>>> o=pycbf.cbf_handle_struct()
>>> o.read_file("../img2cif_packed.cif",pycbf.MSG_DIGEST)

Breakpoint 2, cbf_read_file (handle=0x81f7c08, stream=0x8174f58,
    headers=136281096) at ../src/cbf.c:221
221       if (!handle)
(gdb)
\end{verbatim}

Now you can step through the c...

\section{Things which are currently missing}

This is the to do list. Obviously we could benefit a lot from more
extensive testing and checking of the docstrings etc.

\input "TODO.txt"

\section{Testing}

Some test programs to see if anything appears to work. Eventually
it would be good to write a proper unit test suite.

\subsection{Read a file based on cif2cbf.c}

This is a pretty ugly translation of the program cif2cbf.c skipping
all of the writing parts. 
It appeared to work with the file img2cif\_packed.cif which is built
when you build CBFlib, hence that file is hardwired in.

@o pycbf_test1.py -i -t

\subsection{Try to test the goniometer and detector}

Had some initial difficulties but then downloaded an input cbf file which defines 
a goniometer and detector. 
The file was found in the example data which comes with CBFlib.

This test is clearly minimalistic for now - it only checks the objects 
for apparent existence of
a single member function.

@o pycbf_test2.py -i -t
@{
import pycbf
obj = pycbf.cbf_handle_struct()
obj.read_file("../adscconverted.cbf",0)
obj.select_datablock(0)
g = obj.construct_goniometer()
print "Rotation axis is",g.get_rotation_axis()
d = obj.construct_detector(0)
print "Beam center is",d.get_beam_center()
print "Detector slow axis is", d.get_detector_axis_slow()
print "Detector fast axis is", d.get_detector_axis_fast()
print "Detector axes (fast, slow) are", d.get_detector_axes_fs()
@}


It appears to work - eventually. Surprising

\section{Worked example 1 : xmas beamline + mar ccd detector at the ESRF}

Now for the interesting part. We will attempt to actually use pycbf for a real
dataprocessing task. Crazy you might think.

The idea is the following - we want to take the header information from some
mar ccd files (and eventually also the user or the spec control system) and
pass this information into cif headers which can be read by fit2d (etc).

\subsection{Reading marccd headers}

Some relatively ugly code which parses a c header and then tries to interpret
the mar ccd header format.

\subsection{Writing out cif files for fit2d/xmas}

some more infomation from the user and the create cif files.

\subsection{A template cif file for the xmas beamline}

This was sort of copied and modified from an example file. It has NOT been checked.
Hopefully the four circle geometry at least vaguely matches what is at the beamline.
